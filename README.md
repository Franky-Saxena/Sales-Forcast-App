# Sales Forcast App

This project includes a so much work First of all we did the EDA and do the data cleaning and uses a `linear regression` to the predicted price for the property and after checking the accuracy of that model I just save the model as `model.pkl` and after that I just loaded that model into the `flask App` and given the parameters as required and then just predict the sales price of that property and display it on the Web App.
Tech used:
* Flask
* Linear Regression
* Matplotlib
* pickle
* numpy 
* jsonfiy
* render_template

## To See UI
run a following command in command prompt
```
python app.py
```
## Deployment
Prepare your dataset:
```
1. Data Extraction
2. Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Building and Tuning
5. Save the model
6. load it into flask app
7. predict the price
8. and display the price on the web app
9. Pushing code to Github
```
